# Ford GoBike System Data pattern exploration

- Apply inferential statistics to real-world scenarios (bike trip dataset) using Python.

- Apply data visualization to show insights in the data.



## some interesting relationships:
- subscribers ride much shorter trips compared to customers on each hour of the day that point toward using trips during going and returning from work that is relatively close to home( deduced from short period of trip time ).

- customers used bike trips over weekends usually for tours.

- subscribers ride much shorter trips compared to customers for all ages,indicating that customers usually used it for entertainment.

- customers show pattern of large trip duration around 20 and 53 years old indicating high entertainment periods.
